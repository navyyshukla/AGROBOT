# AGROBOT: Automated Seed Sowing Robot

A college project focused on designing and building a cost-effective, automated robot for seed sowing in small-scale agriculture.

---

## Key Features

* **Automated Movement:** The robot navigates autonomously on the ground.
* **Intelligent Seed Sowing:** Utilizes a servo motor for precise seed dispensing.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** An ultrasonic sensor detects and avoids obstacles in its path.
* **Soil Viability Check:** A soil moisture sensor checks if the ground is suitable for planting before sowing seeds.
* **Wireless Control:** The robot is operated remotely via an HC-05 Bluetooth module and a custom smartphone application.
